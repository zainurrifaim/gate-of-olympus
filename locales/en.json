An RTP of 95% means that, over millions of spins, the machine is programmed to pay back 95% of all money wagered. The remaining 5% is the casino's profit. In the long run, the house always wins.",
  "learning_psychology_title": "üíé The Psychology of Gambling",

Flashing lights, exciting sounds, and \"near misses\" all trigger dopamine releases in your brain, making you want to play more. \"Losses disguised as wins\" (where you win back less than your bet) can also trick you into feeling like you're winning when you're actually losing money.",
